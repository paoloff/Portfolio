## Statistics Projects in R

1. In this project, we predict the grades of the last exam of the course Statistical Modeling I at UIUC using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR):

2. Again using MLR, we analyzed the Crime Rates in the US for the year 1960 and built a model to predict it using other geographical data:

3. Using one-way and two-way ANOVA, we investigated the effects of different variables in the length-of-stay in hospitals for patients which contracted nosocomial infections:
