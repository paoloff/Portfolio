A list of some of my projects

## Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Movie Reviews (R and Python)

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to perform Sentiment Analysis on movie reviews. The model was trained from a database of reviews taken from iMDB. 

Specifically, given a review in the form of a text, the model will identify whether the review is positive or negative. For this purpose, I utilized techniques such as text vectorization, Logistic Lasso Regression and Neural Networks.

## Movie Recommendation App from Users Reviews (Python, R and Shiny)

Here, I developed a model and an app to recommend movies using machine learning. If a user wants to receive recommendation, he can either rate a couple of movies of specify his favorite gender, then the algorithm will return a list of movies which the user will probably like. The main recommendation method is the [IBCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item-item_collaborative_filtering).

Both Python and R were used. The recommendation methods were first manually coded in Python for validation and later implemented in R using external packages. The app was deployed using ShinyApps (link below).

Python Notebook for testing the recommendation methods: https://nbviewer.org/github/paoloff/UIUC_DSE/blob/main/STAT542-Statistical-Learning/Projects/Project%204%20-%20Movie%20Recommendation%20App/main.ipynb

## Statistics Projects in R

1. In this project, we predict the grades of the last exam of the course Statistical Modeling I at UIUC using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR):

2. Again using MLR, we analyzed the Crime Rates in the US for the year 1960 and built a model to predict it using other geographical data:

3. Using one-way and two-way ANOVA, we investigated the effects of different variables in the length-of-stay in hospitals for patients which contracted nosocomial infections:
